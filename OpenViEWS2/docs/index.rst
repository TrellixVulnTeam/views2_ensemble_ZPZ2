ViEWS
=====

ViEWS is a project focused on forecasting political violence.
To do this we fit models to data and use those models to predict the likelihood of future conflict.
Most of the code in this package is focused on this task and provides a framework for doing this correctly and easily.

This document is a work in progress.
We apologise for any confusing formatting or layout.
